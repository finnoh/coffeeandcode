I am a graduate student in ["Data Science in Business and Economics"](https://www.uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/wirtschafts-und-sozialwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/faecher/fachbereich-wirtschaftswissenschaft/wirtschaftswissenschaft/studium/studiengaenge/master/master-programs-in-business-administration/data-science-in-business-and-economics/) at the University of Tübingen. During my studies, I have assisted at the university as a tutor and student research assistant. Currently, I am doing a semester abroad at Texas A&M university in economics. Recently, I was an intern in data science at [Lidl](https://www.kununu.com/de/lidl-deutschland).

As part of my bachelors thesis, I have analyzed the Hot Hand phenomenon in NCAA basketball. In my studies, I learned about methods for supervised and unsupervised machine learning, explainable AI, ethics in machine learning and focused strongly on econometrics.  

I view this blog as an opportunity to connect with people and to learn about, explore and experience great work in data science and beyond. Its purpose is to provide value for other people.
