I am a graduate student in ["Data Science in Business and Economics"](https://www.uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/wirtschafts-und-sozialwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/faecher/fachbereich-wirtschaftswissenschaft/wirtschaftswissenschaft/studium/studiengaenge/master/master-programs-in-business-administration/data-science-in-business-and-economics/) at the University of Tübingen. During my studies, I have assisted at the university as a tutor and student research assistant at the chairs for Financial Accounting, HRM & Organization and Marketing. In the spring of 2021, I did a semester abroad at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu) (College Station, TX), in their master's of economics.

As part of my bachelors thesis, I have analyzed the Hot Hand phenomenon in NCAA basketball. As part of a seminar thesis, I tried to make predictions on a movies success based on its film poster more "understandable" by making use of the [LIME approach](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime).

In my studies, I learned about methods for statistical and probabilistic machine learning, explainable AI and ethics. Beyond that, I focused strongly on econometrics and I have a good theoretical background in the domain of economics.

Besides my studies, I have also gained data science experience in industry and governing entities. By working as an intern at [Lidl](https://www.kununu.com/de/lidl-deutschland) and the [German Central Bank ("Deutsche Bundesbank")](https://www.kununu.com/de/deutsche-bundesbank). 

I see the contents of this blog as a way to connect with other people, explore ideas and as a scratchpad for myself. Of course, I created all of this to the best of my knowledge and with good intentions. If you see any mistakes or wrong attributions, do not hesitate to contact me - I would greatly appreciate it!
