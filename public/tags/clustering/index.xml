Life Expectancy in different countriesIn this article, we want to take a look at time-series clustering. Great time-series data can be acquired with the WorldBank-API. For starters, we will query the life-expectancy for men and women from all available countries.
In a next step, we calculate the average life-expectancy as: \[LE_{avg} = \frac{LE_{men} + LE_{women}}{2} \]. Note that this does not take different populations of men and women into account, they are weighted equally.</description>
