      <description>What is Kaggle? One of the top communities for data science is the online-community of kaggle.com. There are tutorials, discussions, datasets and online competitions on this website. Beyond that, kaggle is one of the most important tools of the open source data science community. Not only through the sharing of code and datasets, but mostly by crowdsourcing data science projects through competitions. Even top notch tech companies have leveraged the power of these competitions and reward participants with high prizes (at the time of writing, the highest being $100,000 offered by Jane Street Group).</description>
